# Objective
The objective of this demonstration is to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.

# Steps Followed:
1) Identified my local IP using "ipconfig" command in the terminal.
2) Inside Nmap,Ran the TCP stealth scan command "Nmap sS 192.168.1.107" which showed me the open ports,their states and the services the ports use.
3) Recorded active IPs and open ports.
4) Researched the common services running on the above detected ports.
5) Identified the potential security risks.
6) Saved the scan results as a txt file.
