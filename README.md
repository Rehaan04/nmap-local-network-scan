# nmap-local-network-scan
This project demonstrates how to scan your local network using Nmap to identify open ports and potential security risks.

# Objective
To discover open ports on devices in your local network and assess network exposure.

# Steps Followed:
1) Identified my local IP using "ipconfig" command in the terminal.
2) Ran the TCP stealth scan using the command "nmap sS 192.168.1.107",This showed me the open ports,their states and the services the ports use.
3) Recorded active IPs and open ports.
4) Researched the common services running on the above detected ports.
5) Identified the potential security risks.
6) Saved the scan results as a txt file.

# Result
A clear view of the open ports,states and services in your local network
